# Geospatial Solutions for Smart Grid Implementation

## Project Description:
- The current project aims to use the potential of geospatial technology in conjunction with the computational and communication technologies towards implementing a ‘Smart Power Grid’ network for select regions of India.
- A smart grid is an electricity network that uses digital and other advanced technologies to monitor and manage the transport of electricity from all generation sources to meet the varying electricity demands of end users. A smart grid system has multi-fold advantages compared to the traditional electricity grid system in that it can be (a) monitored real-time or near-real-time, (b) allow digital communication, (c) have advanced metering infrastructure, (d) Distributed Energy Resources (DER) integration including renewable energy resources and (e) automation, thus with increased reliability.
- While the larger objective for such studies can be an operational model of a smart grid, the current project objectives limit to developing prototype sub-models representing different phases or levels of the total system.
- All major components of the smart grid system have spatio-temporal domain and can be potentially modelled and mapped using geospatial techniques. This gives both the managers and the users a unique opportunity to effectively utilise the resources.
- The methods would include using of geospatial data (analysis ready satellite data proxies (raw and derived), GIS data and auxillary information) and AI/ML models to achieve the objectives.
- Major deliverables targeted at the end of the project will be (a) spatial models and interactive maps towards implementing a smart grid and (b) web/mobile apps

Predicting future land use and land cover (LULC) using AI/ML and satellite data is an exciting and important task :

### Step 1: **Data Collection**
First, gather historical satellite data for your region. This data will provide information about past land cover and land use patterns. Common sources of satellite imagery include:

1. **Landsat (USGS)**: Provides free satellite imagery with a 30-meter spatial resolution.
2. **Sentinel-2 (ESA)**: Offers higher resolution imagery (10, 20, 60 meters) and is freely available.
3. **MODIS (NASA)**: Provides data for large-scale monitoring with daily updates, but lower spatial resolution.
4. **Commercial Providers** (like Planet, DigitalGlobe): For high-resolution imagery, though it’s usually not free.

You’ll also need auxiliary data, such as:
- **Climate data** (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
- **Topographic data** (elevation, slope)
- **Soil/vegetation data**

The historical satellite data should ideally span multiple years to account for temporal variations in land use/cover changes.

### Step 2: **Data Preprocessing**
The satellite images typically require preprocessing to ensure they're ready for analysis:

1. **Image Alignment and Registration**: Ensure that the images align spatially by performing image registration if using data from multiple dates.
2. **Cloud Masking**: Remove clouds and cloud shadows from the imagery to prevent misclassification.
3. **Radiometric and Atmospheric Correction**: To convert the raw image data into usable reflectance values.
4. **Georeferencing**: Ensure the satellite data is georeferenced to a common coordinate system, which helps when combining multiple data sources.
5. **Resampling and Scaling**: Resample the data to a consistent resolution if needed.

### Step 3: **Feature Extraction**
From the preprocessed satellite images, extract relevant features. Common features include:

1. **Spectral Bands**: Different satellite bands (e.g., red, green, blue, NIR) help identify different land cover types.
2. **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**: Useful for detecting vegetation.
3. **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)**: For identifying water bodies.
4. **Land Surface Temperature (LST)**: Can help understand land temperature variations.
5. **Texture Features**: Using statistical texture measures (e.g., GLCM) to identify land cover patterns.

### Step 4: **Data Labeling (Supervised Learning)**
If you're using supervised learning, you'll need labeled data (i.e., ground truth). You can either:

1. **Use Existing LULC Maps**: Many regions have publicly available historical LULC datasets, such as:
   - **Corine Land Cover (CLC)**: For European regions.
   - **GlobCover**: Global land cover data at 300m resolution.
   - **National Land Cover Database (NLCD)**: For the United States.
   
2. **Manual Labeling**: If no existing labeled dataset exists, you may need to manually label certain areas of your images based on visual inspection or expert knowledge.

Label your data for different land cover types like urban, water bodies, forests, croplands, etc. If you have a large region, you may want to label multiple patches over time.

### Step 5: **Model Development**
Select a machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) model for LULC classification and future prediction. Here are a few approaches:

#### 1. **Supervised Learning**
You can start with traditional machine learning algorithms like:

- **Random Forest**: Widely used for classification and has the ability to handle non-linear relationships.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For classification tasks, especially with high-dimensional data.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Can also be used for classification if computationally feasible.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**: For higher accuracy and handling complex interactions between features.

#### 2. **Deep Learning**
If you have access to a large amount of data, deep learning models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** can be used for more precise land cover classification and prediction tasks. You may also explore **U-Net** architecture, which is widely used for segmentation tasks in satellite imagery.

- **Pretrained Models**: Models like **ResNet** or **VGG** can be fine-tuned for land cover classification tasks.

#### 3. **Temporal Modeling**
Since you're interested in future land use prediction, it's important to incorporate temporal information. A few approaches include:

- **Time Series Models**: Use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict land cover changes over time.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Can capture temporal patterns and relationships.
- **Markov Chains**: For modeling land cover transitions between different classes.

#### 4. **Transfer Learning**
Transfer learning can be particularly useful if you're working with deep learning models, as you can use pretrained models from similar tasks and fine-tune them for your specific case.

### Step 6: **Model Training**
- Split the data into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets.
- Train the selected ML or DL models on the training set using the labeled data.
- Evaluate model performance on the validation set.
- Fine-tune the model hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Once the model performs well on validation data, test it on unseen data (test set).

### Step 7: **Model Evaluation**
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
2. **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced classes.
3. **Kappa Coefficient**: Measures the agreement between predicted and actual land cover.
4. **Confusion Matrix**: Helps evaluate how well the model is classifying each land cover type.

### Step 8: **Future Land Use Prediction**
For predicting future land use/land cover, you can:

1. **Time Series Prediction**: If you have temporal data (e.g., images from different years), you can predict future land cover by learning from past trends. Time series models (like LSTM or RNN) will help make predictions for the coming years.
2. **Markov Chain Modeling**: Create a model that can predict land use transitions, which is useful for future land cover predictions (e.g., predicting how urban areas will expand based on past trends).
3. **Scenario-based Modeling**: Use your model to predict different future scenarios (urban growth, deforestation, etc.) by applying different policy changes or environmental factors.

### Step 9: **Post-processing and Visualization**
Once you get predictions, you may want to:

1. **Generate Maps**: Visualize the predicted land cover on a map using GIS software (like QGIS or ArcGIS).
2. **Change Detection**: Compare the predicted future land cover with existing maps to identify areas of significant change.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Assess areas that are at risk for environmental degradation or urban expansion.

### Step 10: **Model Deployment and Monitoring**
Once your model is ready:

1. **Deploy**: You can deploy the model into a geospatial environment (such as a GIS platform) or through cloud platforms.
2. **Monitor**: Set up a monitoring system to regularly update predictions as new satellite images become available.

### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - **scikit-learn**: For traditional ML models.
  - **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch**: For deep learning models.
  - **SentinelHub/Google Earth Engine**: For accessing satellite data and performing preprocessing.
  - **GDAL, rasterio, geopandas**: For working with geospatial data.
  - **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Collect satellite data** (historical images for the region).
2. **Preprocess the data** (correct images, remove clouds, etc.).
3. **Feature extraction** (NDVI, texture, etc.).
4. **Label data** (use existing LULC maps or manually label).
5. **Select and train model** (ML or DL algorithms).
6. **Evaluate model** (use accuracy, F1-score, etc.).
7. **Make future predictions** (temporal prediction, Markov Chains).
8. **Post-process** and visualize the results.
9. **Deploy** the model for continuous monitoring.

# Geospatial Solutions for Smart Grid Implementation
  - Project Code: BTP-2022-107
## Project Description:
-
    - The current project aims to use the potential of geospatial technology in conjunction with the computational and communication technologies towards implementing a ‘Smart Power Grid’ network for select regions of India.
    - A smart grid is an electricity network that uses digital and other advanced technologies to monitor and manage the transport of electricity from all generation sources to meet the varying electricity demands of end users. A smart grid system has multi-fold advantages compared to the traditional electricity grid system in that it can be (a) monitored real-time or near-real-time, (b) allow digital communication, (c) have advanced metering infrastructure, (d) Distributed Energy Resources (DER) integration including renewable energy resources and (e) automation, thus with increased reliability.
    - While the larger objective for such studies can be an operational model of a smart grid, the current project objectives limit to developing prototype sub-models representing different phases or levels of the total system.
    - All major components of the smart grid system have spatio-temporal domain and can be potentially modelled and mapped using geospatial techniques. This gives both the managers and the users a unique opportunity to effectively utilise the resources.
    - The methods would include using of geospatial data (analysis ready satellite data proxies (raw and derived), GIS data and auxillary information) and AI/ML models to achieve the objectives.
    - Major deliverables targeted at the end of the project will be (a) spatial models and interactive maps towards implementing a smart grid and (b) web/mobile apps
